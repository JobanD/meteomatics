# VINTER Assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project was created as per the request of Vinter during the interview process

## NOTES

Some key things to note:

### To run locally:

After pulling git repository, proceed to directory with package.json file and run 'npm install'
Following that you may run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Future Implementations

Things I would Implement if I had more time include:

- Cleaner Aesthetic, cleanup of paddings/margins
- Better incorporate form and implement animations
- Add backend solution to generate Oauth token and then make API request on the server side
- Add more data vizualization objects

### Navigate Folder Structure

My folder structure is as follows; src folder includes assets, components, hooks, and styles folders.

- Assets are for images or other files
- Components are for React Components (This is a functional component based project)
- Hooks are for custom hooks
- Style folder is for css, each react is paired with stylesheet with the same name to make navigating easier

### Deployment

This app is deployed using AWS at [PROJECT](https://master.d22rr826ehtia1.amplifyapp.com/ "PROJECT")
Unfortunately, the deployed version is not currently running
I will fix this in the future, the API call is getting blocked.
